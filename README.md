# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game

Overview:
Tic Tac Toe, a classic and universally recognized game, is a simple yet engaging two-player board game. The game is typically played on a 3x3 grid where players take turns marking a cell in the grid with their respective symbols: 'X' or 'O'. The objective is to align three of their symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally before the opponent does.

Gameplay:

Players: Two players, one using 'X' and the other 'O'.
Objective: Achieve a straight line of three consecutive marks (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) on a 3x3 grid.
Turns: Players alternate turns, each selecting an empty cell to place their mark.
End Conditions: The game ends when one player successfully aligns three marks or when all cells are filled without a winner, resulting in a draw.
Console Game Project in Java:
The Tic Tac Toe console game project developed in Java provides a textual interface for players to enjoy the game directly in the terminal. This project encapsulates the fundamental aspects of the game through an interactive and user-friendly command-line experience.

Features:

Game Board Representation:

The 3x3 grid is displayed in the console, updating dynamically after each move.
Clear differentiation between player marks (X and O).
Player Interaction:

Players input their moves via keyboard, selecting the grid position using a numbering system.
Input validation ensures players select only available cells within the grid.
Game Logic:

Implementation of turn-based mechanics to alternate between players.
Automatic detection of win conditions and draws.
Responsive feedback indicating illegal moves, game status, and results.
User Experience:

Informative prompts guide players through the game, from start to finish.
Clean and concise output provides a clear view of the current game state.
Code Structure:

Modular design with distinct classes handling the board, game logic, and player interactions.
Use of loops and conditional statements to manage game flow and decision-making.
Learning Outcomes:
Creating this Tic Tac Toe game in Java serves as an excellent project for understanding basic programming concepts such as:

Control Structures: Loops, conditionals, and switch-case statements.
Data Structures: Arrays for managing the game board.
OOP Principles: Encapsulation and separation of concerns through the use of classes.
User Input Handling: Reading and validating user input from the console.
